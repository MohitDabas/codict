# Codict

Codict is a tool that I coded because I need Quick Code's snippets, relevant, methods, functions definitions and their usages without setting up a new programming environment or downloading and reading programming Language's documentation while Doing SAST. The framework can also be used for learning programming.

The Codict's Interface Contains three different individual blocks the first one is for searching functions,getting relevant cod snippets from Github Search

Second block is for your code which your going to inspect and investigate. No need to open Code in editor just paste your code here and copy it directly to interpreter or compiler.

The Third block is for compiler and the interpreter from Repl.it
